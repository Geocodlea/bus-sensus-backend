# Bussensus

Backend for Bus Sensus Application

This is a real life project for the Public Transportation System of Brasov, created together with a team of learning IT enthusiasts, composed of: Project Managers, Web Designers and Web Developers (Java for backend and JavaScript for frontend).

To start the application, you need to do the following:

- install and start mysql server;
- create an empty database named: "bus_sensus_db";
- build project;
- run the project;

After doing that the "bus_sensus_db" will be populated with some dummy data and that's it for the backend.
